# Clustering
a) **K-Means Clustering from Scratch**

Concept: K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups data into 'k' number of clusters. The algorithm iteratively assigns each data point to one of k groups based on the feature similarity.

Visualization: Often visualized using scatter plots, with data points colored based on their cluster membership and centroids marked distinctly.

b) **Hierarchical Clustering**

Concept: This technique builds a hierarchy of clusters either by a bottom-up approach (agglomerative) or top-down approach (divisive). It does not require the number of clusters to be specified a priori.

Visualization: Represented using a dendrogram, a tree-like diagram that shows the arrangement of the clusters produced by the corresponding analyses.

c) **Gaussian Mixture Models Clustering**

Concept: This model assumes that the data points are generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters. Itâ€™s more flexible than K-means because of how it calculates the belonging of data points to a cluster.

Visualization: Data points in a Gaussian mixture model can be visualized using ellipses that encapsulate the data points, with each ellipse representing one Gaussian distribution.

d) **DB Scan Clustering Using PyCaret**

Concept: DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) identifies clusters as high-density areas separated by areas of low density. PyCaret simplifies the implementation of this algorithm.

Visualization: Similar to K-means but also highlights outliers or noise which are not included in any cluster.

e) **Anomaly Detection using PyOD**

Concept: Anomaly detection identifies unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior. PyOD is a Python library for detecting anomalies in multivariate data.

Visualization: Often shown as a time series plot with anomalies marked in a different color or with markers.

f) **Clustering of Timeseries Data using Pretrained Models**

Concept: Involves grouping similar time series data. Pretrained models can be used to extract features from time series data, which are then clustered.

Visualization: Typically displayed as line plots for each time series, with color coding to represent cluster membership.

g) **Clustering of Documents using LLM Embeddings**

Concept: This involves using state-of-the-art language models to convert text documents into vectors (embeddings) and then clustering these vectors.

Visualization: Visualized using dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or PCA to plot the document embeddings in 2D or 3D space.

h) **Clustering with Images using ImageBind LLM Embeddings**

Concept: Similar to document clustering, but uses embeddings derived from images. ImageBind LLM is used to obtain these embeddings.

Visualization: The high-dimensional image embeddings are reduced to 2D or 3D for visualization, often with each point representing an image.

i) **Audio Embeddings using ImageBind LLMs**

Concept: This involves extracting features from audio files using embeddings and then applying clustering algorithms to group similar audio files.
Visualization: Often visualized in a reduced dimensional space, where each point represents an audio file.
